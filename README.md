# Metropolitan Bus Management System

Welcome to the Metropolitan Bus Management System!

This is a C++ project that utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to create a program that manages all the buses in a metropolitan city. The program reads an input file and populates a set of Bus objects, which can then be queried by the user through transactions entered in the console.

This program is designed to demonstrate the following OOP concepts:

Static arrays of objects
Class aggregation
Operator overloading
Static members
Class managers
Abstraction
Dynamic allocation
The program is divided into several stages, each branch building upon the previous one to add new functionality and features.

To run the program, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Simply compile the source code and run the executable file. The program will prompt you for the input file and guide you through the rest of the process.

I hope you find this program to be a useful tool for managing buses in a metropolitan city. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository.
